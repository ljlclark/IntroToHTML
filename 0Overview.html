  <h3 id="title">Intro to HTML5 Course Overview</h3>
  <p>
    There are several challenges presented by the environment in which this
    course will be taught.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Most students have little experience with computers and tasks such as
      navigating the file structure, creating folders and files, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      The students will have limited time to actually modify the HTML documents
      due to a small number of available computers.
    </li>
    <li>
      The course should probably be taught in English as the available
      supporting documentation on the Web and elsewhere is overwhelmingly in
      English.
    </li>
    <li>
      For these students, English is a second or third language.
    </li>
    <li>
      A useful real-world application should be chosen as the class project to
      help the students see how HTML can be used and to provide repetition
      which will reinforce the learning process.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    To help mitigate these challenges; the following approach is recommended.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the class project, a basic HTML5 Tutorial web site will be created. This
    will provide the following benefits.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Demonstrate a real-world use of HTML.</li>
    <li>
      Creating the Web site HTML files will provide the experience requred for
      using the computer file system.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide a reference tutorial, written by the students, that they
      can use to recall key HTML subjects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each page in the HTML Tutorial will be created with simplified
      English and will cover only one main topic to avoid confusion.
    </li>
    <li>
      The first pages will be created as Text files to allow the students
      to create the content without being confused by the HTML tags.
    </li>
    <li>
      The previous Text pages will be updated with each new HTML element the
      student learns to gradually reinforce the learning process.
    </li>
    <li>
      The previous Text pages will be converted to HTML pages as the student
      learns the HTML elements required to make them true HTML pages. This
      provides many opportunities for repetition to reinforce the learning
      process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Results in a tangible product the students can show to others and
      can say they built.
    </li>
  </ol>
