  <h3 id="title">What is an HTML Entity?</h3>
  <p>
    If the element text contains reserved characters such as &lt; or &gt;
    Then they will confuse the browser and the page may not display as
    intended. The reserved characters will not display in the text.
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve this problem, the character must be coded in the text as an
    HTML Entity. An Entity starts with the ampersand "&amp;" character and
    ends with a semicolon ";". As in: &amp;lt;.
  </p>
  <p>
    The less than sign is coded as &amp;lt; and the greater than sign is
    coded as &amp;gt;. The &amp; character is coded as &amp;amp;.
  </p>
  <p>
    To display a paragraph element:
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A Paragraph&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
